# Python Experiments
This repository contains the initial code I created when learning to use GitHub as part of DSCI 8133 *Foundations of Applied Data Science* at Mississippi State University.

## Plan

Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a Jupyter https://www.https://jupyter.org/ notebook that will interact with the file.
